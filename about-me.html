    <h1 style="color: blue;">About Me</h1>

    <p>Hi there! I am Nooria Amiri a girl with big dreams, a curious heart, and a deep love for technology. I come from Maidan Wardak, Afghanistan, but my story begins in the bustling city of Kabul, where I was born, raised, and inspired.</p>

    <p>Growing up surrounded by challenges made me stronger, more determined, and more passionate about making a difference. I believe that every line of code can create change  not just on a screen, but in the real world. <br>That is why I have set my heart on becoming a software engineer.</p>

    <p>To me, technology is more than wires and code  it is a language of hope. It is a way to solve problems, connect people, and dream bigger than borders. I want to use what I learn to give back to my community, to empower girls like me. <br>And to prove that nothing is impossible when you believe in yourself.</p>

    <h2 style="color: blue;">People Who Inspire Me</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>My family â€” for teaching me resilience and kindness</li>
      <li>Afghan women who rise despite all odds</li>
      <li>Visionaries like Elon Musk who dare to dream wildly</li>
    </ol>
